It had been a while since I had used Flask so I just made this basic CRUD application so that I could practice Flask essentials. It intentionally has no styling because I strictly wanted to focus on the Flask side of things and how to send and receive data from a database using Flask.

## Installation

```
touch .env
```

> Make sure to fill `.env` with correct contents (see [`.env.example`](/.env.example)).

## Usage

```
python app.py
```
